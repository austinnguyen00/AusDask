# AusDask

This is my analysis of commonly required skills for data occupations - Data Analyst, Data Engineer, and Data Scientist - in Australia in 2022. 
You can check the full analysis web version of this at this link: [AusDask](https://austinnguyen00.com/ausdask.html).

The data source is scrapped using Python Selenium in [scrap.py](scrap.py) and cleansed afterwards.

You can check [Analysis notebook](analysis.ipynb) for the data cleansing and exploratory data analysis code.

The clean dataset in excel format can be downloaded [here](output/data/Data_jobs_Australia.xlsx).

The analytics dashboard is built with Tableau Public and can be seen [here](https://public.tableau.com/views/SkillsforDataJobs/DataJobsinAustralia?:language=en-GB&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)
